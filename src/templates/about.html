      Raw Talk Podcast is a graduate student-run podcast all about medical science, and the people who make it happen.
      We focus on the journeys, perspectives, and expertise of
      health researchers, professionals, students, patients, and community members
      at the University of Toronto and beyond.
      We are based at the Institute of Medical Science in the Temerty Faculty of Medicine, at the University of Toronto.
      </p><p>
      Our mission is to stimulate medical science research
      within the life sciences community at U of T and beyond;
      to provide guidance to current and prospective graduate students;
      and to engage and educate the public in medical science innovation and translational research.

      <p>
      Raw Talk Podcast would like to acknowledge the land on which the University of Toronto and the podcast operates.
      For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of
      the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River.
      Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island
      and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.
