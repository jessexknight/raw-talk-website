      Raw Talk is a graduate student-run podcast at the University of Toronto
      about medical science, and the people who make it happen.
      We focus on the journeys, perspectives, and expertise of
      health researchers, professionals, students, patients, and community members
      at the University of Toronto and beyond.

      Our mission is to promote a research culture
      within the Faculty of Medicine and broader life science student community;
      provide guidance to current and prospective graduate students;
      and to engage the public in medical science innovations and translational research.

      <p>
      Raw Talk Podcast would like to acknowledge the land on which the University of Toronto and the podcast operates.
      For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of
      the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River.
      Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island
      and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.
