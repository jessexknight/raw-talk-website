And, you know, that's FN used to be there. The last year they were there was 2010, which was the first year that I went to SFN. And I thought it was fabulous. But right. They stopped going there. Right? It was that because it was too not big enough, or I don't think so. I'm not not sure whether"

So, as I mentioned on James saravanamuttu, I just finished a Master's this past summer at UF, University of Toronto. And my kind of background and research was we use magnetic brain stimulation to study the neurophysiology of Parkinson's disease and patients. So that's kind of where I'm coming from. And now I'm in medical school at UFT. still involved in research though and love neuroscience. Love the brain."
