I had studied mechanics in engineering, science and so on. So I had a good background, but I hadn't done the biological side of it.

I did degrees in both Kinesiology and psychology, and then liked them both equally. So I did my graduate degrees in sports psychology. And as I was finishing my doctoral work, I got what I thought was my dream job, which was a sports psychology consultant for a team of athletes that were headed into the Olympics. I thought this is a fabulous opportunity. And most of them were young female gymnasts, and I was asked to work with these athletes to make them a little more mentally tough, more resilient. Some of them were crying in training or losing their skills. And my job was to help them with these things. And then I discovered by talking to these young people, that there weren't any issues with them, that they were responding quite appropriately to situations that no young person should have to endure. And so I thought, Well, what do I do? Do I teach them coping skills so they can just go back and try and deal with the abuse they were suffering? Or do I try and change the sporting practices that led to the abuse, and so I fell into the whole area of athlete maltreatment. I tried to work with the coaches and the sport administrators to suggest that there were healthier methods to develop talent in young people. And their response was of course quickly to fire me. So that was a very important lesson, you know, I lost that position. But at the same time, I couldn't stay within that system and work within their conditions. So then I turned my research to athlete maltreatment, and trying to affect coach education so that different strategies would be incorporated."

But curiously, there's been very little research done on bullying in sport or sport teams. And the suspicion is that's because there's such a focus on sport teams being cohesive and gelling together that there almost is an assumption that bullying wouldn't occur. We've conducted a number of studies within the last five years primarily with inter-university teams, and have discovered, not surprisingly, that bullying does exist. And bullying in sport differs a little bit from bullying outside of sport, because it tends to be based on ability. So even if you're a senior member of the team, but you don't have the same ability, you're going to be bullied. So it was less so about seniority on the team. As it was  athletic ability."

    "text": "So sports an interesting world because for the most part, it's directed towards performance outcomes, things like winning, you know, gold medals first place and so on. And, in fact, the funding system used in sport in Canada is performance based. So those athletes and teams are those sports that do particularly well, internationally get more funding, and those that don't do as well get less funding. So that leads to a climate in which there's can be a win at all costs attitude; that the focus is on the outcome, regardless of the means by which you get there. And if those means are harmful, and it still leads to a gold medal, the gold medal is what is the focus and I think the the best example of that is the Larry Nassar case in USA Gymnastics, where here we have someone who perpetrated a sexual misconduct against hundreds of athletes across decades. Some of those survivors were on the USA Olympic gold medal team. Which leads us to question two things. Well, many, many more questions. But the some of the questions that leads to include, how much better could those athletes have done if they hadn't experienced sexual abuse? How many athletes were left in the system before they got to the Olympic level because of the sexual abuse? And of course, the question of, there's no way that someone can abuse so many people over such a long period of time, without someone knowing or someone suspecting. And so it's important to look at athlete maltreatment in, in a broad way, look at the whole ecological system around sport. You know, where were the sport administrators where were the coaches where were the physiotherapists and sports psychology consultants in that case, there's lots of pressing questions. And it's not those aren't limited to the Nassar case, we've had our own Canadian examples as well."

A body that has the authority to say, you know, you've engaged in misconduct, we're taking away your license. And so what we see happen is coaches who engage in misconduct, just move from club to club or from province to province. And and that is also a barrier to dealing with this problem. We have this system in sport that kind of assumes if you've been a good athlete in that sport, you can coach, which, of course bears no resemblance to any other sector. Just because we've all been students doesn't mean we can teach, for example, so but making coaching more professional and having a regulatory body I think would also be helpful. It's not the only answer, but it's a piece of the puzzle."

And so, you know, remembering what the purpose of sport is, and educating around that, I think the other thing is at the elite level, there's nothing wrong with focusing on winning, aiming for the medals in the standings. But to think more deeply and critically about how to produce those outcomes. So rather than thinking that we have to yell and scream and be critical of athletes in order to make them mentally tough, to look at, how do we make them as whole and as well as possible, because when, when any of us thinks about when we perform the best at whatever- school, our jobs, in our relationships, it's when we feel good about ourselves and we feel supported. And so, you know, just imagine the athletic performances, we might see if athletes had that kind of support and foundation to produce those those performance outcomes."

We've also learned that with a controlling style of coach, there's higher dropout rates. So we mustn't forget about all of those young people who could have reaped the benefits of sport participation, but dropped out because of these controlling coaching methods. So on the flip side, what's encouraged in the literature and borne out by research is what we call athlete centered coaching or humanistic coaching or democratic coaching. Lots of words are used for this. But it's it's as it suggests, it's focused on the athletes health and well being first and foremost. It's a style that involves athletes in decision making at an age or developmentally appropriate way. It considers the athletes well being not just while they're in the sport, but in an extended responsibility way. So a coach who coaches in athlete centered way asks the question, How are the experiences that young person is having today, going to affect their development long after they've left sport, and that's a critical piece."

So I've spent my life working with children. And the one thing I've learned the one takeaway, I think the most important one is working with children to help them to believe in their potential, and then supporting them to fulfill that potential, I think that is the most important work. And once you have that mindset, you just don't know where it's gonna take you. And that's how I think how our story played out. Because, you know, when you look at potential and the parts about having a dream, and it's so important for young people, to have a dream, and my kids have a dream, and, you know, and but you just never know what's gonna take you. And so it has taken them to where they, they want it to go. And but we know that not every dream is fulfilled, just like not every tree will bear fruits, but that tree serves a purpose. And so they fulfill their dreams, they continue to learn and grow. But even if they didn't reach their destination, it you know, that journey still serves a purpose. In terms of peak performance. No parent, or I never did, I can't speak for every parent. But we didn't start out raising our children to be NHLers, you know, we didn't start out raising them to be educators with my, which my daughters are. I mean, we started out spending time with them. You know, and and so that was the the key. I don't mind saying this. I've said it many times before. People want like they've asked me, did PK love skating? At two and a half and three and four? Yeah, I think you enjoyed the activity. But what I can say is that he loved being with his parents. That time with him, is what he looked forward to. Yes- when he was skating, we were there. But I believe that I really believe that if mum and dad, were not there with him, I don't think he would have enjoyed it as much. Because skating, especially when you're learning to skate, it's not fun. No one loves falling down, you know what I mean. And so what he enjoyed was the time we were spending with him. And then the skating started to improve. And I remember one of these things used to say to me, Daddy, Daddy, look at me, look at me. And you could, you could see him getting better. And you could sense that he's feeling better about himself. And when our children are doing something, especially at a young age, and it allows them to feel better about themselves, geez, you know, they start to feel better about their world and their place in it, and you just never know where it's gonna take them. I think that's where it starts in terms of building, you know, elite athletes, I don't think we started out to create an annually child, or to create an Olympian and PK playing the Olympics, but it's really to to spend time with them and develop that relationship with them. That is so important. You know, that's the foundation."

But I often say that Maria and I, that's my wife, Maria, we push them more in the baby carriage than push them to skate. Okay. And, and so but I also on the other hand, I've said that I've never met a child or work with a child who could not have use some pushing. Right? I've never, but if you spend all of your time pushing them, they'll never end up where you want them to be in life. The trick is to inspire them. Parents, the trick is to inspire them, and see motivation. I can motivate PK, but unless he's inspired, it's not gonna last. Motivation is just that a thing that happens now, inspiration is more long term. It's like the long distance is like the marathon. That's what happens when you're inspired. You know, I can motivate you to run, and you do it quickly. And it's done. And so how do we inspire our children because it's not motivating them, it's inspiring them and inspiring them. It's something that happens from the inside, you know, so the trick was for us, and I said it, I said it before, and I'll say it again, it started out with spending time with them, spending time with them. If I said PK go and shoot pucks in the basement, maybe he'd go once or twice, but he's not gonna he's not gonna do it five or six times a week. And he did it because we were there with him. When he was shooting pucks in the basement. I was there with him or mom was there with them. When Taz and chip Taz, you our eldest daughter, nastasia, play basketball at York University. And she was a pretty good player as many records. But we were there with her in the basement when she's doing her dribbling drills, or we take her to the park, you know, we're there with them. Because kids at a young age, they want your attention. And they want your time. And so that's where the inspiration starts. You know, and, and so it starts out with them, loving the fact that you're there. And eventually, they'll start loving what they're doing more than the fact that that our mom's there. You know what I mean? They're not looking out for me as much as they grow older. And that's why I like to say to parents, you know, you're clear the way paved the way and get out of the way. You know, when I saw we started out clearing the way, and then we pave the way then you get out of the way, you know, when PK was young, and I use PK, because everyone knows him. I would carry his hockey bag at one time for him because it was way bigger and heavier than him. And he wasn't strong enough. But I but I can you I always ask this question. Can you imagine if I was still carrying his hockey bag at 14? You know what I mean? And so that's inspiration now- now he wants to carry his bag. I don't have to tell him to there is a point in time around 14. Now between 12 and 14, I didn't have to tell him about the importance of working out. I didn't have to tell him to go train. I didn't have to tell him to go shoot parks. That's inspiration. He's inspired. He has, he has found the passion. He has found his calling. And once kids find their passion, and they find that thing they love to do. We don't have to tell them to do it."

How will you use those gifts you have to do better in this world. And so sometimes young people will believe in themselves. But we know that we have many who don't. And so I like to tell them to believe in their potential, because and that's why it's so important for young people to know what they're good at. You know, PK, and I use him as an example, he knew what he was good at, at a very young age before he was five, before he was three. And even probably before he could articulate it. He was good at skating. That's one thing he was good at. When children know what they're good at, wow, they become so much better at doing things in school, and in life, that that feeling is transferable to other aspect. And, and so to me, that's how they grew confidence. And that's all they, they will grow that belief in themselves. Potential looks like a three legged stool. It looks like a stool with three legs. I want everyone here to imagine everyone listening, I want you to draw a three legged stool in your mind. In the seat of it. I want you to write the word potential. One leg is a dream leg, that's the first that's an important part of potential having a dream. The middle leg is your belief system is your belief leg. The third leg is your action leg.

And so it's that confidence, and that belief in yourself and in your potential, that, \"Wow\", it makes you powerful. And that helps you to take on that helps you to deal with adversity. Because as you chase that dream, you know the part of potential, you're going to have doubts or people who doubt you, you will have setbacks, you will have challenges. And and so because you believe in your potential, and and because that feeling that you get from knowing what you're good at, and from working to be better, that helps you deal with those that help you to deal with adversities.

The lessons learned from losing, you know all kinds of life skills. That sport can help with and and there's a large body of research that looks at life skill development through sport so that evidence is certainly there. And on the flip side, we know that sport also has the potential to lead to very harmful experiences, maltreatment being one of them. In our latest national prevalence study of athlete maltreatment, we found that the athletes reported connections between their experiences of abuse and neglect. with mental health challenges, like depression and anxiety, eating disorders and disordered eating was a huge piece of that puzzle. And so there are clear ramifications of the very prevalent experiences of abuse and neglect. They often play out in terms of mental health of athletes. The other important piece to note is very few athletes actually report their experiences of abuse and neglect. In fact, less than 10% of our sample of 1000 athletes ever reported their experiences. Now, some of these experiences were characterized by psychological abuse, some with neglect, and some was sexual abuse. And even in the recent disclosure by Megan Brown, a U of T, former U of T athlete track and field athlete who alleges her coach at Guelph engaged in underage sexual relationship with her. She didn't disclose it until, you know, years and years later. And athletes don't disclose or report because of fear of what it will mean for their athletic careers, that they may get their funding cut or they won't get chosen for a team, they're very clear that they don't have a safe place to take their concerns where they won't be punished as a result of reporting."

The counter argument that's used in Canada is that we have such a large volunteer base of coaches.

And in fact, the, you know, the first component of Rowan's law is that concussion awareness, education is mandatory in participants in sports that are covered by law in Ontario, which is great, because, you know, being aware of the fact that you don't have to hit your head, you just have to shake it, being aware of the fact that it's invisible many times and there aren't necessarily objective manifestations of disorder, there may be, but there may not be it may be entirely subjective symptoms that are manifesting, but that there nonetheless is a concussion in that situation, that understanding that it takes a variable amount of time so that you can't predict, you know, they're gonna, cause they're going to be out two weeks, you don't know that, you know, everyone's different, and so on. So the increase in awareness, you know, has been great nonetheless, there persist some of these myths, or you weren't hit in the head, you're not concussed whatever. Those those are much less than they were 20 or 30 years ago. The difficulties we face now are, you know, swimming in a sea of ignorance. I mean, we don't really have a super great handle on all the different types or components of pathology that exists within what really is a clinical syndrome, the concussion syndrome because it's a heterogenous beast, there are multiple different components of pathological anatomy that occur with different concussions and, and there may be subtypes based on pathology, but all of this pathology that we learn about from animal models and autopsies and, and some very fancy and expensive MRIs and MR spectroscopy that we can do clinically, is not applicable to clinical care. So, you know, I think, as we learn more about the biology and we improve the diagnosis of concussion to include diagnosis of the of the pathology, rather than just treating it as a purely clinical syndrome, you've got symptoms, you have a concussion because that's still where we're at and in 2020, for the most part, that the treatment will improve."

Those types of acute trauma, concussions, unfortunately, facial trauma, dental trauma, all kinds of things happen commonly in contact and collision sports or even in non contact sports that are nonetheless at risk of trauma such as extreme sports, aerial sports, you know, all kinds of things people fall down and get hurt. And then there are the so called overuse injuries and I've got quotation marks around that in the air because it's not just about doing too much, generally, it's about moving badly. Movement quality is probably the most common cause. So for example, running poorly, causes runners knee or patellofemoral pain and throwing poorly causes throw or shoulder or subacromial impingement, the the underlying issues being not just that you ran too much or through too many times, but that you did so poorly. So there are lots of common overuse syndromes as well."

The extrinsic factors include primarily the choice of activity, which is the primary determinant of the risk of acute trauma, you know, if you jump off cliffs and wingsuits, you are likely to get hurt. If you play collision sports, like tackle football or full body contact ice hockey, you are likely to experience conducive trauma, it's just unavoidable. Other extrinsic factors include the use of safety equipment to mitigate the risk of some injury. So you know, wear a helmet when you're cycling, and you're less likely to die. rules that are based on safety, not hitting the head or checking from behind in hockey, etc. and playing in a safe venue not you know, playing basketball on a paid surface full of broken glass and dirty needles. Intrinsically, we look at people's movement capacity. Those are the main intrinsic variables, there are quite a number, I mean, things like age, and mass and sex are all intrinsic variables that contribute to risk someone. But things that you can do something about are your strength, your flexibility, your motor control, and I think that is the most important one, your ability to control your body in three dimensional space under the influences of gravity and inertia. And to be able to hold your body in correct positions and move your joints in correct sequences in correct alignment. That's what I was talking about poor quality running, the primary fault is to allow the hip to rotate in, bringing the knee medial to or inward from the foot, and the arch of the foot collapses. And this pattern of movement, which is exceedingly common, it happens to all of us, to some extent, is probably the single biggest movement quality issue causing injuries in sport- is poor running, where the knee comes in and the hip rotates internally. So we have the research on this is recent, actually just we're talking about the last couple of decades, and it's evolving and it's at the point where people are doing studies attempting to show prospectively and randomized with controls etc. that doing exercises to strengthen hip external rotators and abductor muscles that strengthening these muscles, improves running quality and reduces the risk of these extremely common overuse problems like Runner's knee, and tibial stress fractures and plantar fasciitis at the end, the list goes on."

As much as I would like to say it was my role to prevent injuries with the team, (it most certainly was not) at that point in the evolution of the franchise, the strength and conditioning, which is really where you get out injury prevention is movement quality and strength and conditioning. And I hate to use the term load management but you know, it wasn't invented by either the Raptors or kawhi. Leonard, it's, it's been around for eons. But gradually progressing with physical activities and and strengthening people appropriately. That was primarily the responsibility of the strength and conditioning coaches, and to a lesser extent, the head trainer, as he was called, or the head therapist who worked with us as physicians, but it's not like we were consulted on what the guy's programs would be, we would sometimes say, hey, this, this was usually in reaction to an injury. If somebody gets jumpers knee, then we'd have a discussion about what sort of squatting or lunging they're doing, and whether they're focused on different phases of the movement, whether they're doing it with one leg or two, and how much weight and how many reps they're doing. But it's not like that was that we were involved in that daily. Since that time, professional sport medicine has evolved in a favorable direction to mimic the Olympic model. It was at the Olympic level that the notion of an integrated support team first arose, and that you should have a team of people working together rather than an isolated silos to do what's best for both health and performance capacity on the team. And an integrated support team needs to have a physician, a therapist, physiologist, a bio mechanist, a strength and conditioning coach, a mental performance consultant, a mental health professional, a coach, the coach has to buy in or doesn't work. So back then we'd loosely had an nice team but we didn't meet. We didn't. When I was with the Raptors, we didn't do physiological testing. I was doing with the Olympic teams I was working for but not with the professional team. They weren't interested. Well, no, they wanted, you know, I got told what they wanted. When we started, they said okay, we want everyone to have a stress test and a stress echocardiogram. And I'm like, why do you need all that? You don't need to stress that going, everybody? Yes, we do- this is the NBA. Completely medically unnecessary. But it was the standard of care in the league."

And it is very clear in American law, it's not legislated, but they have a body of case law that makes it clear that the doctors do not actually decide anything, we do not have authority to dictate, you know, Thou shalt not play or thou shalt play. The people who decide whether or not not an athletes gonna play are the other two corners of the triangle, the athlete has to be willing to play or not, and the team has to be willing to put them on the court or ice or field or not. The exception to that which exists only in Ontario (and Canada now) is concussion and Rowan's law, where legislation, (thank you Swapna) has invested authority in the physician. But outside of that legislation, there is no legislated or case law authority invested in the physician, the physician is an advisor to the other two parties. So I could advise an athlete I don't think you should play because of these risks to your health. And I can tell the team I don't think that athletes should play because of those risks to the team. Now, with many teams that I work with, including all teams at the University of Toronto, where it is department policy, that the coach will follow the physician's advice. So then that invests authority in the physician because the sport organization has invested that authority in them and you and then then the coach tells the athlete you have to we have to follow the doc's advice. That is not the case at the professional level. And certainly my advice was always overwritten by both athletes and coaches in the NBA, you know where I give my best advice and say, I think this is what should happen. They're like, thanks, Doc. And then it's their right to decide. So positions are advisors, that is legally the case at the amateur level, except that at the amateur level, such as at university, and even with the Olympic Games I work with, as a matter of policy, the team follows the doctor's advice.

In fact, that research suggests there's no limit to how much activity you can do. And there's no such thing as quotes \"overuse\", because you can run more, it's just like there's no limit to weekly mileage beyond which no one can run without injury. It's a question of how they get there, they have to run well, first quality again, quality is job one. And then they have to progress, the mileage of their running at a suitable rate, such as not more than a 5% per week increase. And we also worry about them taking off too much time during the downtime, because if they go down to zero for two months, they have to start from scratch to build up again.

You can't plan for 20 because it was pretty much a guarantee. If he ran for 20, his knee would swell. And we knew he had pathology and he had holes in his articular cartilage and so on.

They've all been forced to self reflect on these practices that we've traditionally accepted in sport, first of all, are harmful. They're not okay anymore. And very importantly, they're not representative of practices used in other sectors where young people reside and work. Teaching strategies have moved from those kind of punitive controlling methods to being child centered and democratic. Parenting has moved from using physical punishment and autocratic styles to more democratic child centered parenting. And I think this has been a wake up call for sport to get in line with the rest of Canadian society's expectations and standards around how young people should be treated. Most Most of the headlines we see in the papers about abuse in sport has to do with sexual abuse. And our prevalence study as well as other prevalence studies have indicated that it's actually the psychological abuse that is the most prevalent. And that's, I think, going to be the hard one to tackle because that's the part that's normalized. That's the yelling, screaming coach, that's athletes exercised for punitive reasons until they collapse. It's those kinds of psychologically abusive practices that are really being challenged now. There's been too many, you know, headline stories in this country, about young people in particular, going into sport because it's supposed to be this wonderful environment for growth and well being and development of skills to be used later on in life, and finding that there are environments characterized by abuse and neglect. So it's, it's led to, I think, everybody in the sport community, regardless of level, contemplating what we do now and how we can do better. And that's a great opportunity. There are new educational tools being created. There's been a universal Code of Conduct established for all stakeholders in sport across the country, there are new mechanisms being developed to enable athletes to have a safe place to go to report their concerns.

So the educational programs are changing their focus that way, it's not that we're not going to still take care of athletes, there'll still be a sport medicine component as long as people play games, but everyone should be exercising not just people who are playing competitive games.
