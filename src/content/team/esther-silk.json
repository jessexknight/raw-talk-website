  "bio": "Hey Raw Talk listeners, I'm Esther, one of the audio engineer team members! This is my first year as part of the podcast and I'm incredibly excited to facilitate the transfer of scientific knowledge from us to you! I'm also a master's student at the Institute of Medical Science where I'm studying interventions of deep brain stimulation as a therapeutic approach to treatment resistant depression. When I'm not doing stereotaxic surgery in the lab or mixing sounds for the podcast I love to travel, take photos and go running. Happy listening!",
