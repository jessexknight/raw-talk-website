This is my second season with Raw Talk and I'm so excited to continue to make the magic behind this podcast happen! At U of T, I'm a master's student at the Institute of Medical Science where I'm studying deep brain stimulation as a novel therapy for treatment resistant depression. When I'm not at my lab or mixing sounds for the podcast I love to travel, cook and watch movies. Happy listening!",
