  "bio": "Hello! I'm a 6th year PhD student in the Institute of Medical Science here at U of T. When I'm not podcasting, I study cancer genetics at the Hospital for Sick Children. I've been with Raw Talk since Season 1 doing everything from hosting to communications! It's been exciting for me to watch the show grow and evolve. We have so many unique perspectives on diverse topics in medicine, all inspired by working being done in our own backyard - The University of Toronto. Other interests: Coffee, sleeping, soccer, cooking, coffee, yoga, rock climbing, comedy, coffee, napping, reading, and writing.",
