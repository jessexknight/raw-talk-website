  "bio": "Hello! I'm a 4th year PhD student in the Institute of Medical Science here at U of T. When I'm not podcasting, I study cancer genetics at the Hospital for Sick Children. I've been with Raw Talk since Season 1 doing everything from hosting to communications! As one of this year's Executive Producers I'm excited to bring more stories to the show and really engage with the research community in the Faculty of Medicine this year. Other interests: Coffee, sleeping, soccer, cooking, coffee, yoga, rock climbing, comedy, coffee, napping, reading, and writing."
