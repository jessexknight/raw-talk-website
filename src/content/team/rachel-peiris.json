  "bio": "Hello, my name is Rachel and I'm a second-year MSc student at the Institute of Medical Science at U of T. My research takes place with Dr. Rob Nolan at the Toronto General Hospital, where I investigate the impact of a digital health program on quality of life and associated markers of wellbeing in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Outside of my master's program, I'm researching the effects of intergenerational trauma on resiliency in academia with Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Aside from all of that, you can find me binge-watching my favourite shows, writing all sorts of nonsensical and melodramatic prose, and sneaking candid shots of my friends. I'm thrilled to be joining Raw Talk as a host this year and to be learning, along with all of its listeners, about fascinating topics under the umbrella of medical science.",
