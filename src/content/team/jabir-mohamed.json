  "bio": "Hello hello, Jabir here and I'm a recent MSc graduate of the IMS. At Raw Talk, I co-lead public relations efforts, manage branding, and spend a lot of time thinking about program development. Although I love everything about the show, it's the people involved - scientists, health professionals, and faces you see on this page - that bring me most joy. Outside of podcasting, I'm into swimming, finding new music, and spending time with my nephews and nieces.",
