  "bio": "I'm a Clinical Research Coordinator at Toronto General Hospital working on studies in lung transplant measuring health outcomes and quality of life in patients. I've always been passionate about bringing science stories out of the lab and into daily life. That's why I'm pumped to be on the RawTalk team to share exciting content and make it accessible to our listeners (give us a shout @rawtalkpodcast). When I'm not in the lab you can catch me rolling through the Six on my bike, perfecting my biryani recipe in the kitchen, and working hard to keep my plants alive!",
