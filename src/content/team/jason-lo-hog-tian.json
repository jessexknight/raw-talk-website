  "bio": "Hi everyone! My name is Jason and I’m a show host for Season 6 of Raw Talk Podcast! I’m a fourth year PhD student at the Institute of Medical Science investigating how stigma impacts the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV. I’m passionate about scientific communication and I listen to a variety of audiobooks and podcasts of course! I’m super excited to be working with the team this year and look forward to sharing interesting science research with you!",
