I'm a third year PhD student at the Institute of Medical Science investigating how stigma impacts the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV. I'm passionate about scientific communication and I listen to a variety of audiobooks and podcasts of course! I'm super excited to be working with the team and look forward to sharing interesting science research with you!",
