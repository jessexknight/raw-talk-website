  "bio": "What's going on, listeners. My name is Anton and I am really excited to return for my third season with the Raw Talk team. I have recently graduated from the Institute of Medical Science here at U of T. My PhD work focused on using functional brain imaging (fMRI) to understand brain mechanisms associated with chronic pain. Outside of the lab, I enjoy staying active by playing sports, hiking, and cycling. Can't wait to share what season 4 has in store â€“ so make sure to tune in! One love.",
