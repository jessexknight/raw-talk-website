  "bio": "I'm a second-year MSc student in the Department of Nutritional Science. My research investigates the lesser-known role of the large intestine in the absorption of folate and if folic acid supplementation affects the genetic regulation of colonic folate transporters. When I'm not in the lab, you can find me in my kitchen trying out new recipes, rock climbing (even though I'm afraid of heights), or navigating the streets of Toronto by bike. I'm super excited to work alongside an incredible team for Season 5 and share the latest research in science through storytelling. Happy listening!",
