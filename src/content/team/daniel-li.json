  "bio": "Hi all! I'm Daniel and I'm a 2nd year MSc student with the Institute of Medical Sciences researching the immunological effects of a novel COVID-19 treatment at the Feld Lab. I'm looking forward to being a show host for Season 6! I spend a lot of my free time either making music, listening to music, or cooking. So if I'm not in the lab or at school, I'll probably be at home listening to music while trying out a new recipe!",
