  "bio": "Hey podcasters - I'm CJ, and I'm a photographer for Raw Talk Podcast! A returning member to the RTP team, I look forward to capturing essential shots that either convey the atmosphere of the episode, or helps put faces to names! Currently, I'm finishing up my Master's in LMP, studying the effects of specialized lipid mediator molecules on in vitro glaucoma models! If not in the lab, you'll catch me bouldering in Niagara Falls, taking tons of photos of dogs, or going on morning runs along the lake!",
