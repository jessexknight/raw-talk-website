  "bio": "Hey podcasters - I'm CJ, and I'm a consultant photographer for Raw Talk Podcast! As a photographer to the RTP team, I look forward to capturing essential shots that either convey the atmosphere of the episode, or help put faces to names! Currently, I'm finishing up my Master's in LMP, studying the effects of specialized lipid mediator molecules on in vitro glaucoma models! If not in the lab, you'll catch me bouldering in Niagara Falls, taking tons of photos of dogs, or going on morning runs along the lake!",
