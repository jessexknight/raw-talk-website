  "bio": "Hey podcasters- I'm CJ, and I'm a photographer for Raw Talk Podcast, working with Nathan and Mehran! As a new member to the RTP team, I look forward to capturing all the essential shots that will assist listeners in visualizing faces to an episode! Currently, I'm entering my second year of my Master's in LMP, studying the effects of small lipid molecules on glaucoma models! In my spare time, you'll catch me bouldering outdoors, volunteering with the Toronto Distress Centre, out for morning runs and taking cooking classes!",
