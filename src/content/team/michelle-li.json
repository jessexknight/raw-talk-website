  "bio": "Hey Raw Talk listeners! My name is Michelle and I am a first-year MSc student at the Institute of Medical Science studying anemia management in surgery. I am so thrilled to be one of your show hosts and I look forward to bringing some exciting, educational, and inspiring stories to you. Outside of school, I love capturing the beautiful scenery around me through photography, travelling, all things arts and crafts, staying active, and trying out (and more importantly, eating!) delicious recipes. Stay tuned for another great season of amazing content!",
