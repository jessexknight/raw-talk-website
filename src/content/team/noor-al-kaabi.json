  "bio": "Hey folks! I'm Noor, a recent graduate from UTM with a double major in Biology for Health Sciences & Psychology. I'm currently a research assistant with the Kidney Health Education Group at TGH where I work on projects with the goal of improving equitable access to transplants for racialized communities and quality of life for transplant recipients. I'm an advocate for using science communication to bridge gaps between the public, scientists, & healthcare. I'm also passionate about writing and photography as tools for storytelling & advocacy. #keepitraw!",
