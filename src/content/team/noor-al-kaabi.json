  "bio": "Hi! I'm Noor, a 1st year master's student at the Institute of Medical Sciences. I work with Dr. Dmitry Rozenberg at the GoodHope EDS clinic at Toronto General Hospital, and my research is focused on characterizing respiratory issues and their association with physical functioning and quality of life in people with Ehler's Danlos Syndrome. I'm really excited to work with the team to bring you episodes spanning topics in biomedical sciences, health equity and more! Outside of the hospital, I dabble in some photography and digital art.",
