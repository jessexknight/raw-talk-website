  "bio": "Hello world! Second year IMS PhD student here, working with Dr Sharmistha Mishra at St Michael's Hospital. In my research, I simulate HIV epidemics using math and code, with the aim of helping to inform intervention priorities. I'm mainly interested in the influence of modelling assumptions on epidemic simulations. I'm super excited to be working with the amazing Raw Talk Team to explore leading biomedical science research and tackle important ethical issues in health. Outside the lab, I like to go backcountry camping, convince you to try LaTeX, and tweet at politicians about the climate crisis.",
