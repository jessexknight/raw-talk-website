  "bio": "Hi Iâ€™m Elizabeth and one of the Science Writers for Raw Talk! I am a second-year master student in the Institute of Medical Science program. My research focuses on understanding the determinants of the temporal patterns of hemodynamic responses during exercise patients with pulmonary hypertension. Outside of research and Raw Talk, I enjoy martial arts and am currently a fourth-degree black belt. I am very excited to be a part of the team and to explore cool medical science topics!",
