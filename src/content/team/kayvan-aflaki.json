  "bio": "Hey listeners! My name's Kayvan, and I'm in the second year of my Master of Science at the Institute of Medical Science where I'm completing an epidemiology project on maternal mortality in partnership with the Ontario Coroner. My research interests include substance misuse and addiction, especially among youth and pregnant individuals, and refugee health. Outside of Raw Talk, I'm co-president of IMS Students Association (IMSSA). For fun, I like to fly planes and learn about ancient history. When I'm not at St. Michael's Hospital, you can find me backcountry camping or practicing my photography somewhere in a provincial park!",
