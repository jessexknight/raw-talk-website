  "bio": "Hi listeners! My name is Yagnesh and I'm a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Medical Biophysics. My research is focused on understanding the genetic factors that affect the metastasis of Neuroblastoma and whether they can be targeted to make new drugs. I am incredibly excited to join the Raw Talk team for Season 4 as a show host, and I'm looking forward to learning about and sharing some great stories from the researchers here at UofT! Outside of the lab, I enjoy biking around the city, cooking or playing video games. I'm also a big soccer and Man Utd fan so you can always catch me playing pickup somewhere downtown on the weekends.",
