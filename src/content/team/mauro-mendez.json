  "bio": "Hi everyone! My name is Mauro. I’m a second year MSc student in the Institute of Medical Science. I did my BSc in computer science and then worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for about a year. When I started grad school I focused on how we can possibly do generalizable AI when we have limited medical data, and that’s why my research is about simulating medical images to promote AI research in rare diseases. Besides my academic work, I enjoy watching ton of Netflix, reading books, and get a lot of cuddles from my puppy. I’m excited to join the team and provide wonderful content to all our listeners.",
