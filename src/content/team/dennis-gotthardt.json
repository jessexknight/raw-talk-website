  "bio": "Hey everyone! My name is Dennis, I am a fourth Biomedical Engineering student at Ryerson University and currently researching differing pulse wave modulation use cases. I am coming into Rawtalk as a host for the coming season and am excited to delve into science/medicine specific issues regarding Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). Aside from school, research and the show, I am a lover of food, travel and all things coffee. So, if you're in the know of some delicious roasts or cool cafes, please reach out!",
