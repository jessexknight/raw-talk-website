  "bio": "Hello everyone! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Medical Biophysics at University of Toronto. With my project, I am trying to understand how the brain facilitates its memory function and emotion regulation. I am a new Content Developer for the Season 4, and I cannot wait to share informative and thought-provoking stories in Scinences with you all! When I am not wearing my scientist's hat on, I am usually found playing the violin, dancing like nobody's watching in Zumba classes, or watching movies at home.",
