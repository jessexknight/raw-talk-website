I am currently finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto in Neuroscience while also doing some research at Princess Margaret on the side! I'm so beyond excited to be part of the Raw Talk team as a Show Host! I'm keenly interested in the intersection between science and society and I hope that Raw Talk continues to explore that fine balance while promoting science literacy. So stay tuned!",
