  "bio": "Hello everyone! My name is Nazanin (you can call me Naz)! I am currently finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto in Neuroscience while also doing some research at Princess Margaret! I'm so excited to be part of the Raw Talk team as a Show Host! I look forward to bringing listeners along for the journey behind some of the most vital discoveries in science and what that means for the general public. I'm keenly interested in the intersection between science and society and I hope that Raw Talk continues to explore that fine balance while promoting science literacy. Stay tuned!",
