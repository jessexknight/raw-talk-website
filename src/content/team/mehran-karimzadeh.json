  "bio": "I am one of the photographers for Raw Podcast. I am also a post-doctoral fellow at Vector Institute and University of California, San Francisco. My research focuses on how our epigenome changes in metastatic colorectal cancer. The epigenome describes the higher dimensions of DNA such as its chemical modifications, its topology, and which proteins are bound to it. I use machine learning to model and study the epigenome.",
