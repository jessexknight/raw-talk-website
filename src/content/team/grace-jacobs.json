  "bio": "Hi Listeners! I'm a 5th year PhD student in the Institute of Medical Science. I use structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study brain circuitry and heterogeneity across children and adolescents experiencing mental illnesses. I've been a part of Raw Talk since season one, and enjoyed tremendously being an Executive Producer for the past two seasons. I can't wait for all the great stories and science we're going to share with you this year, and to work with such a fantastic team again!",
