  "bio": "Hi listeners! My name is Grace, and I'm a fourth year PhD student in the Institute of Medical Science. My research uses structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging to study brain circuitry and mechanisms underlying psychosis and neurodevelopmental disorders in children and youth. We have some great stories and science to share this season! I'm beyond excited to be an Executive Producer again this year and work with everyone on the Raw Talk team to bring you fantastic content. Check out our episodes and let us know what you think! ",
