  "bio": "Hey! My name is Atefeh and I'm a first year MSc student in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology studying neonatal lung disease. I am so thrilled to be joining Raw Talk Podcast for a third season since I love working with our incredible team to create and promote content that is educational, engaging and accessible for our listeners. In my free time, I enjoy staying active by practicing karate and venturing the city in search of ice cream.
