  "bio": "Hey! I have just finished my undergraduate degree and am so excited to venture into the world of research and complete a Master's degree, because research is mind-blowing as I like to say. This is my first year on the Raw Talk team and I am thrilled to be involved in spreading the word about what we do! I am passionate about encouraging scientific literacy and closing the gap between scientific research and society. It makes me really happy to make and promote content that is accessible so I hope that we can reach as many of you as possible. In my free time, I love spending time with horses and eating all the ice cream one can possibly have. Keep in touch by following us on our social media platforms!",
