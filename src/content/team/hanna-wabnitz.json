  "bio": "Hey listeners, my name is Hanna and I'm a PhD candidate in the department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology. In my PhD, I'm trying to understand the mechanism behind haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn and identify ways to replace the current treatment. This is my third year with Raw Talk and I'm really excited about all the interesting science we'll be sharing with you this year. Outside of the lab, I love to travel and have visited 27 countries so far and lived on 4 different continents.",
