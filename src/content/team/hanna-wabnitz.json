In my PhD, I'm trying to understand the mechanisms behind haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn and identify ways to replace the current treatment. This is my second year with Raw Talk and I'm really excited about all the interesting science we'll be sharing with you this year. Outside of the lab, I love to travel and have visited 27 countries so far and lived on 4 different continents.",
