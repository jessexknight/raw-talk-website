  "bio": "Hey I'm Claire - a new Content Creator for Raw Talk. Right now I am doing research out of Sunnybrook Hospital that looks at pregnancy in women with spinal cord injuries. I just finished my masters in Applied Immunology at U of T where I studied the genetic mechanisms of T-cell leukemia. In my spare time I speak to youth in Ontario about mental health with an amazing organization called Jack.org and I run! I'm so excited to start making episodes of a podcast I've listened to for the past couple years.",
