  "bio": "Hey I'm Claire - a Content Creator for Raw Talk and a 1st year medical student at UofT. I am passionate about health and wellness, particularly women's health, and mental health. Some things I can't go without - breakfast with an XL coffee and Colleen Ballinger's vlogs. This is my second year working as a content creator for Raw Talk and I can't wait to dive into some super cool topics this season!",
