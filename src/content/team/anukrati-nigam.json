  "bio": "Hello, everyone! I'm Anukrati, a Ph.D. student and my research project involves the integration of multi-modal data in neurological diseases. As an engineer by heart and a scientist by profession, I joined the Raw Talk Podcast team as an Audio Engineer for Season 5. Outside academia, I love going to music concerts, doing art and yarn-based crafts, playing musical instruments, going on walks, and travelling. I hope you enjoy listening to the Raw Talk Podcast as much as we love putting it together for you!",
