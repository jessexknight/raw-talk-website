  "bio": "Hi listeners! I'm Thamiya and I'm back for season 5 of Raw Talk Podcast as an advisor. I've learned so much and met so many amazing people on the podcast over the last couple of years and I'm excited to see where where we'll go for the upcoming season. I'm a 6th year PhD candidate at the Hospital for Sick Children, studying the atomic structure of proteins using electron cryomicroscopy. When I'm not in the lab, you can find me at home baking or exploring the great outdoors.",
