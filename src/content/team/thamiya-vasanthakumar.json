  "bio": "Hi listeners! I'm Thamiya and I'm excited to be back for season 4 of Raw Talk as the communications executive. I joined the podcast last year and had a great time working with the team to share the wonderful research happening at UofT. I'm a 5th year PhD candidate at the Hospital for Sick Children, studying the atomic structure of proteins using electron microscopy. If I'm not in the lab, you'll probably find me outside hiking or paddling (or napping).",
