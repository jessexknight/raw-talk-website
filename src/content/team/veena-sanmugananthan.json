  "bio": "Hi everyone, my name is Veena! I'm currently a second year Masters student at the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto. My research involves understanding pain coping in chronic pain patients, and behavioural representations of pain and attention brain mechanism interactions. I'm going to be joining the Raw Talk Podcast team this year as a Science Writer. Aside from my research, I absolutely love going out for runs and drawing in my free time!",
