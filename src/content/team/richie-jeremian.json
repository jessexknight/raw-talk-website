  "bio": "Oh hi there! I'm Richie - a Postdoctoral Research Fellow investigating aging epigenomics in mood disorders, and one of this year's Public Relations Executives. As Raw Talk's Co-Founder, I'm incredibly excited to see the show come into its own with the debut of the 4th season (from our very humble beginnings of recording interviews using microphones that we clipped onto our pens). I look forward to working with all these talented individuals to bring you a fantastic show! When in doubt, #KIR!",
