  "bio": "Hello listeners! I recently completed my PhD at the Institute of Medical Science, studying the ins-and-outs of epigenetics and applying knowledge from this relatively new field to better understand how complex diseases (in particular, mood and psyhiatric disorders) can manifest themselves across the lifespan. For the first two seasons of Raw Talk, I served as the show's Exec Producer, Show Host, and Lead Audio Engineer. I'm very excited to continue hosting this season, and look forward to covering some new topics in future episodes.",
