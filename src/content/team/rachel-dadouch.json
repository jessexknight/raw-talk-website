  "bio": "Hi RTP listeners! I'm Rachel, one of the new content creators. I'm a fourth year PhD doing research in obstetrics and gynaecology (specifically, maternal fetal medicine). My work relates to obesity in pregnancy, mainly on improving the clinical encounter between patients with elevated BMIs and healthcare professionals. Beyond my day-to-day research, I have many interests including science communication (if that wasn't already obviousâ€¦), all things art and design, women's health, public health, hockey, basketball, Middle Eastern everything (politics, culture, etc.), Jewish advocacy, travel - and I'll stop there for now Looking forward to an exciting and enriching Season 5!",
