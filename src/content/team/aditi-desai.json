  "bio": "Hey listeners, my name is Aditi and I'm a first year MSc student at the Institute of Medical Science. For my research, I am investigating the physical health outcomes of siblings of childhood cancer survivors. In other words, I am trying to find out whether cancer and cancer treatment in a particular child impacts the health and wellbeing of other children in the same family. Outside of research, I love to swim, drink copious amounts of coffee, and crack that's what she said jokes to my disapproving friends. I am extremely excited to be a part of Season 3, as I will get to learn about and share all the amazing research that is happening in Toronto. Remember to tune in, and until next time, #keepitraw!",
