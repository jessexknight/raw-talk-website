  "bio": "Hi everyone! My name is Jillian. I am in my third year of the combined MD/PhD program here at U of T. I finished pre-clerkship and I am now pursuing my PhD at the Institute for Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation (IHPME), Health Services Research stream. My research interests include heart failure, artificial intelligence, social determinants of health, and ethics. Otherwise, I am a life enthusiast who loves people, travel, soccer, and coffee. This is my first year with Raw Talk, and I am very excited to work with this dedicated team, meet some inspiring folks, and talk a whole lot of science!",
