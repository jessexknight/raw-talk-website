  "bio": "Hey Listeners! My name is Nathan Chan, and I wear a couple of hats for Raw Talk Podcast! Most of the time, I take photos - giving the voices you hear faces to see. That said, I'm also a graduate student studying neuroscience, and you might also hear me host segments from time to time. I'm currently finishing up my M.Sc. with the Multi-Modal Imaging Group at Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada, where we study neuroimaging and mental health with high performance computing.",
