  "bio": "Hey Listeners! My name is Nathan, and I wear a couple of hats for Raw Talk Podcast! Most of the time, I take photos - giving the voices you hear faces to see. That said, you might hear me host segments from time to time, and I'm also your point-of-contact for any issues regarding Raw Talk Podcast that you don't feel comfortable raising with our Executive Producers. I completed my M.Sc. in neuroscience at the Institute of Medical Science in the University of Toronto, where I partnered with clinician scientists at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health to study the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and apathy through brain imaging and high-performance computing models.",
