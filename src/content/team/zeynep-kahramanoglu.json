  "bio": "Hi listeners! My name is Zeynep and I'm a Scientific Communications Specialist at Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation. I got my M.Sc. from Western University in Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, as well as a collaborative degree in Developmental Biology. I'm thrilled to join the Raw Talk Podcast team for season 6! It will be my 3rd season as a Show Host and Content Creator! I'm a big advocate for science literacy and making it accessible for everyone in a way that is accurate and fun! In my spare time, I enjoy windsurfing, kickboxing and reviewing restaurants in the city with amateur expertise.",
