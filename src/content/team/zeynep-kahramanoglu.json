  "bio": "Hi listeners! My name is Zeynep and I'm a research technician in a cancer immunology lab in Toronto. I got my MSc from Western University in Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, with my thesis focused on ovarian cancer. I'm very excited to join the Raw Talk podcast team as a Show Host for season 4! So hopefully, you'll be reading this in my voice. I'm a big advocate for science literacy and making it accessible for everyone in a way that is accurate and fun! In my spare time, I enjoy windsurfing, kickboxing and reviewing new restaurants in the city with amateur expertise.",
