  "bio": "Hi, I’m Stephanie! I'm a 4th year PhD Candidate in the Institute of Medical Science. I study balance in Parkinson’s disease using virtual reality, brain stimulation, and motion analysis. Outside the lab, I love biking, being outdoors with my dog, and trying new food. Science communication is my passion so I am excited to return for a second season of Raw Talk. This year, I am working on content creation and promo. Can’t wait to share our Season 6 with you all!",
