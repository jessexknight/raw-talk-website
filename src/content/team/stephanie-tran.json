  "bio": "Hey listeners, I'm Stephanie! I am third-year PhD student at the Institute of Medical Science. In the lab, I use a variety of techniques to stimulate the brain and assess how it changes with aging and disease. Specifically, I research sensorimotor control in Parkinson's disease patients. Outside of school, I am addicted to travelling, hiking, and finding the best bakeries. This is my first year with Raw Talk and I am thrilled to be a part of the team. Check out some old gems on our website and follow along with our newly added episode transcripts!",
