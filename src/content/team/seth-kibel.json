I'm currently a second year medical student at the University of Toronto, as well as a part-time researcher at Princess Margaret Hospital where I'm studying how we can use the immune system to fight cancer. Outside of school, I spend my time watching basketball, playing guitar, and trying to find the city's best restaurants.",
