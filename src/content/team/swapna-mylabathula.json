  "bio": "Heyo Raw Talk fam! ðŸ˜Š My name is Swapna and I'm currently in the MD/PhD program doing my research on concussion policy and also on concussion in hockey. I'm aiming to become a clinician scientist with a clinical focus in sport medicine. Alongside academia, I have a passion for translating science into policy at multiple levels of government, and I also love to play hockey and the violin and sitar, learn languages, and do scicomm and outreach with youth through classrooms & multimedia. I am super excited to be returning for another season of Raw Talk Podcast as a show host to create some interesting content with the team and share incredible science stories with all of you! I am constantly inspired by the talented team that I get to work with and the amazing guests whose stories we get to share, so I can't wait for what this season has in store! ðŸ˜Š",
