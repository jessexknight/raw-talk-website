My graduate work focuses on the physical function and supportive care for caregivers and older adults with advanced prostate cancer. I am also passionate about health equity, wellness, the Raptors, and food. (Please send any recipe recommendations my way!) Raw Talk has long been a source of information and inspiration for me. I am incredibly excited to help share more amazing stories and dialogue this year. Stay tuned!",
