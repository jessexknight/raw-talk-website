  "bio": "Hey there! I'm Helen, a MSc student in the Institute of Medical Science. My graduate work focuses on the prognosis and supportive care for older adults with advanced prostate cancer. I am also passionate about student mental health, tennis, the Raptors, long naps in the lab, and food. (Please feel free to send me any recipes or restaurant recommendations!) Raw Talk has long been a source of information and inspiration for me. This year, I am incredibly excited to be joining the team as an audio engineer, and help share more amazing stories and dialogue. Stay tuned!",
