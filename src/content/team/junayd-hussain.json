  "bio": "Hey everyone! My name is Junayd, and I am an incoming Master's student in Epidemiology at the University of Ottawa. I got my BSc from Western University in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, with my undergraduate paper focused on sleep and alcohol use in adolescents. I am stoked to take on this new role as Science Writer at Raw Talk Podcast for Season 6! I am super interested in the role of patients and patient families in their care, and how their conversations with providers can influence their care. In my spare time, I enjoy running, exploring the city, reading, and testing  my patience over LEGO sets and challenging video games.",
