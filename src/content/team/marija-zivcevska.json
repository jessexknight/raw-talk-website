  "bio": "Hi everyone! I'm a recent graduate from the IMS Master's Program where I examined neural mechanisms underlying light sensitivity in various clinical populations. Outside academia, I love to travel and explore new cultures. I'm super excited to come back for my third season at Raw Talk! Our team has grown immensely over the years and I'm looking forward to seeing what's next in store! As always #keepitraw!",
