  "bio": "Hey everyone! Iâ€™m an IMS alum and currently a first year MA student in the Clinical & Counselling Psychology Program at UofT. Aside from school, I love to cook and travel, and of course, be a part of Raw Talk! This has been such a unique opportunity to promote science (and the amazing people behind it) and to highlight stories of lived experience in a thoughtful and engaging way. I've been a part of the podcast since the beginning and it's been incredible to see how much we've evolved and grown over the years. I'm excited for you to continue listening as Season 6 unfolds!",
