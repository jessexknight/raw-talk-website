  "bio": "Hey everyone! I recently completed my MSc at the IMS on supporting the psychosocial and informational needs of patients and loved ones affected by advanced cancer. Aside from research, I love to cook and travel, and of course, be a part of Raw Talk! Not only have I scored an awesome group of friends, but this is also such a unique opportunity for us to promote science (and the amazing people behind it) in a fun and engaging way. I've been a part of the podcast since the beginning and it's been incredible to see how much we've evolved over the years. I'm excited for you to continue listening as Season 5 unfolds and until next time, #keepitraw!",
