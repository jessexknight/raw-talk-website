  "bio": "Hey Listeners! My name is Braeden and I'm currently a second year MSc student at the Institute of Medical Science studying the impact of caregiver burden within informal caregivers when traditional short-stay inpatient surgeries, like total hip and knee replacements, are shifted to outpatient pathways. Outside of school, I often spend my time watching sports, trying to brainstorm the perfect Maple Leafs lineup to end the 54-year drought, and as a coffee enthusiast I'm always up for the classic Starbucks vs. Timmies debate. I am super excited to be joining the Raw Talk Podcast team as a show host this season! Looking forward to the amazing stories in store for Season 6.",
