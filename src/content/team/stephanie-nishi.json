  "bio": "Hi All! I'm Steph, a Registered Dietitian and Postdoctoral Fellow at the Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Spain investigating the relationship and impact of nutrition on cardiometabolic and cognitive health.  My goal as a clinical researcher and educator involved in chronic disease prevention from a nutritional perspective, is to advance evidence-based practice and knowledge dissemination with the ultimate aim of being a part of informing public health policy and nutrition guidelines.  Along with research, nutritional sciences, and making credible scientific information accessible and engaging, I am currently attempting to learn Spanish, as well I enjoy cooking, playing volleyball, and am always looking for new things to discover! I am excited to be returning to the podcast team for a third season, this year as an Advisor. It is great working with this team and meeting so many knowledgeable guests as I find each episode continues to inspire and inform - so stay tuned for what this season has in store!",
