I'm so excited to be part of a team that melds two of the loves in my life: science, and podcasts! Outside of the podcast, you can catch me in the lab studying developmental immunology and immunotherapy. In my spare time I'm an avid baker, and I love running and cycling too. I'm really looking forward to seeing how Season 4 unfolds, and to sharing some exciting stories on science and medicine with you all. ",
