  "bio": "Hey listeners! Season 4 marks my third year with Raw Ralk, and I'm jumping into the role of Show Host. In Dr. Robert Chen's Lab, I use a variety of tools to stimulate people's brains in order to study how the healthy human brain works, as well as to see what goes on in Parkinson's disease. Outside of research, I facilitate a support group for people living with Parkinson's and love playing basketball!",
