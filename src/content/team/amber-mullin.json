  "bio": "Hey there, listeners! My name is Amber, and I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the department of Molecular Genetics. My research focus is on the genes that regulate glutamate receptor levels at the surfaces of synapses, and how disruptions to this system can lead to increases in aggression in patients with developmental disorders like Cri du Chat and autism. I have been involved with radio from a young age, and am super happy to now be part of such a great podcast team! Aside from science, I have a deep interest in ancient history, and particularly in mythology, as using stories to communicate important ideas is something that humans have been doing for thousands of years!",
