  "bio": "Hey Raw Talk Listeners! I'm Frank and I'm very excited to be back as a Show Host for Season 5 and to share my passion for the stories of science and medicine with the U of T community and the world. When I'm not podcasting or doing other science advocacy work, I'm a graduate student studying cancer predisposition at the Hospital for Sick Children. Outside of science, I'm an avid baker and cook - I love trying new foods from around the world and doing my best to recreate them (sometimes with mixed results).",
