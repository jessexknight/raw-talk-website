  "bio": "Hey Raw Talk listeners - Sumi here! I'm a first-year LMP MSc student studying the role of B cells in lung transplant rejection. It's my very first season on Raw Talk and I can't wait to dig deep researching and contributing ideas behind the scenes for our upcoming episodes! Apart from being an immunology and podcast nerd, I'm also a big fan of art, philosophy, skillfully avoiding getting hit by a car while riding my bicycle on the busy streets of Toronto, and coffee. In fact, on select mornings, you can catch me pulling espresso shots at Balzac's on Market Street (still working on the Raw Talk logo latte art, however).",
