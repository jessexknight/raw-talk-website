  "bio": "Hey! I am Adrine, I am now a third-year Ph.D. in the Department of Molecular Genetics. I study the genetic variations of the VHL gene and its effect on cancers. I am also An international student from Brazil. As a scientist and technology enthusiast, I am alarmed that as a society we still fail to communicate and integrate research findings to our everyday lives. It was by consuming a lot of science outreach content, that I not only decided to pursue a career in research but also understood my values as a global citizen. Therefore I engaged in scientific communication. I created the podcast @42semanas that shared evidence-based obstetrics and medicine through real birth stories.You can also follow me for some PhD life adventures on my Instagram @lasciencewitch",
