  "bio": "Hello, I am Adrine, I am an international student from Brazil, currently in the 4th year of my Ph.D. studies. I am part of the Department of Molecular Genetics at the Faculty of Medicine working with the variant interpretation of two genes using functional genomics technics. I am an enthusiast of science outreach and education, that is why I created the podcast \"42 semanas\" and a youtube channel with my partner, both in Portuguese. When I am not volunteering or working in the lab I run, bike and do trails around the city with my puppy Ellie.",
