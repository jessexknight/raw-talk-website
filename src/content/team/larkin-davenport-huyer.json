  "bio": "Hi there, I'm Larkin. I completed a Masters of Public Health at Queen's University in 2019 and am entering my final year of the accelerated nursing program at UofT. I am really interested in the health system and how we can make it more efficient, ultimately, to make sure every patient and person accessing our health system gets the best care! In addition to school I work part time in two research areas: knowledge translation/implementation sciences and nurse-industry relations/corporate influences on health. Aside from school, I love to be outside running, biking and hiking, and to eat (sometimes attempt to cook) delicious food. This is my second year with the podcast and I am looking forward to taking a deep dive into new topics and sharing our work with you!",
