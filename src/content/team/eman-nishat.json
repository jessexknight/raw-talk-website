  "bio": "Hi! I'm Eman and I'm a second year MSc candidate in the Department of Physiology and Collaborative Program in Neuroscience. My research uses brain imaging techniques to study underlying microstructural changes in the developing brain following a mild traumatic brain injury, such as a concussion, and how these changes may influence cognitive and social outcomes in children and youth. I'm super excited to join Raw Talk as part of the Social Media and Promotions team. Social media is a strong tool in making science communication accessible and I can't wait to work with the team to share the best content!",
