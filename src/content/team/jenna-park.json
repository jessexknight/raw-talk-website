  "bio": "Hey everyone! I'm Jenna, a Master's student in the Department of Medical Biophysics. I'm currently located at the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning (PGCRL) at SickKids, where my research is focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind neuroblastoma metastasis. Specifically, I look at signaling pathways that enable this cancer to spread to specific areas such as the bone and the brain. Outside of research, my other passions include scientific communication, exploring the city, trying new foods, playing sports, and discovering bomb playlists on Spotify.",
