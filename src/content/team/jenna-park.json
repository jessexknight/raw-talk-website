  "bio": "Hi listeners! My name is Jenna, and I'm super excited to be one of the new Show Hosts for Season 5! I can't wait to learn more about the cool research happening here at UofT and to be able to share it with everyone! Currently, I'm a 2nd year MSc student in the Department of Medical Biophysics researching what signaling pathways regulate Neuroblastoma metastasis to the bone and the brain. Outside of my passions for all things research and scientific communication, you can find me anywhere food is involved, on the volleyball court, traveling, or trying new activities with my friends.",
