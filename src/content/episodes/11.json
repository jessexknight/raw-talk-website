  "notes": "Someone wise once said, \"a great mentor does all the things a good mentor does, but also knows when to let go.\" On this month's theme of Student Engagement, we sit down with some people who've helped influence us along our paths, and talk all things inspiration, professional development and translational skills. We begin with the world's one and only Dr. Reinhart Reithmeier, Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Toronto, Special Advisor to the Dean of Graduate Studies on graduate professional and leadership development, and mentor extraordinaire. Dr. Reithmeier tells us about how his interest in science was piqued after going squirrel watching in the Ottawa Valley, recalls a few pivotal figures in his life who taught him to excel in academia, and details what he's doing to pass on his wisdom to the next generation of graduates- a must-listen for all students. Until next time, keep it raw!",
