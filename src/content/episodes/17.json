  "notes": "Episode 17 of Raw Talk focuses on chronic pain, and we are fortunate to have highly acclaimed researcher, Dr. Karen Davis, join us to share her expertise. We discuss the contribution of neuroimaging in understanding pain perception and pain mechanisms, in addition to some common misconceptions and advances in the field. This segment-packed episode brings research, patient and clinical perspectives together to let you hear the various voices that participate in the field of chronic pain. In \"Ask a Student\", PhD candidate Kasey Hemington talks about her experience as Dr. Davis' student and her motivations to pursue pain research. Complementing those insights, we sit down with a fellow graduate student living with chronic pain to uncover how their pain is perceived and managed, and why interprofessional care is the best way to go. Finally, we introduce a \"Clinician's Corner\" segment that explores chronic pain management from the lens of a physician, Dr. Najam Mian. Don't miss out! until next time, keep it raw!",
