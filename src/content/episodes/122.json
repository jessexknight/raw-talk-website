  "notes": "Trauma-related injuries are severe and can often lead to long-lasting adverse patient outcomes such as physical damage, mental health struggles, diminished quality of life, and even death. In fact, it is one of the leading causes of death both nationwide and globally. In this episode, we sit down with three experts in trauma care: Dr. Homer Tien (Trauma Surgeon at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and President and CEO of Ornge), Dr. Suzanne Beno (Medical Co-Director of the Trauma Program at Division of Paediatric Emergency Medicine, Hospital for Sick Children), and Dr. Brodie Nolan (Emergency Physician and Trauma Team Leader at St. Michaelâ€™s Hospital). Each guest shed light on the current state of trauma care in different fields. Dr. Tien provides us with a comprehensive overview of the trauma systems and the intersection between civilian and military trauma care. Dr. Beno shares insight into pediatric trauma care and how it compares to adult trauma care. And finally, Dr. Brodie Nolan provides us with an overview of the current research in trauma care. Join us as we dive deep into the fascinating world of trauma systems and research.",
