  "notes": "We are wrapping up this month's theme of \"Student Voices\" by focusing on the perspectives of future graduate students. On this episode, Richie, Alex and Eryn team sit down to play our favourite game, \"Kat Chats\", to answer some of the most common questions from our undergrad listeners. We talk about applying to (and enduring) grad school, and what doors can open after graduation. We also hear from Dr. Vasu Venkateswaran, who tells us more about the application process to the IMS and what stands out in successful applicants, and touches upon the IMS Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). This episode is certainly not one to miss, especially if you are a current undergrad student who's curious about pursuing grad school! Until next time, keep it raw!",
