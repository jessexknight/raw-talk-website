  "notes": "In this two-part episode, we discuss two very important topics related to Women's Health; Endometriosis and Cervical Cancer. \\nPart 1: \\nEveryone wants to be seen and heard, especially in the context of their health and well-being. Unfortunately, this hasn't always been the case for individuals with endometriosis. In Part 1, we take a deep dive into understanding endometriosis and gain some valuable insight into the journey of being diagnosed from our guests. We hear from Dr. Jamie Kroft (Obstetrician-Gynaecologist and Gynaecologist surgeon at Sunnybrook Hospital) and Amanda Weston (Research Quality Associate, University Health Network) who has lived experience with endometriosis.",
