  "notes": "Did you know that nearly 500 million people globally suffer from some form of irreversible kidney-related disease? These individuals may wait years before receiving a transplant! In this installment of Raw Talk, Dr. Lisa Robinson, Paediatric Nephrologist and Senior Scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children chats with Melissa about the forefront of kidney disease research. James and Anton also pay a visit to Dr. Markus Selzner, transplant surgeon and collaborator of Dr. Robinson's, to learn about new breakthroughs in kidney transplantation. Moreover, as Chief Diversity Officer at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Medicine, Dr. Robinson discusses initiatives currently being implemented to tackle inequality at the University. James and Anton are then fortunate enough to sit down with Anita Balakrishna, Diversity Strategist at the Faculty of Medicine, and delve deeper into the proactive work being done to curb discrimination at different stages of the student experience. Until next time, keep it raw!",
