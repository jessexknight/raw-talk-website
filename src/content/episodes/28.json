  "notes": "Over the past decade, academics and media outlets alike have been telling us that stem cells are going to revolutionize regenerative medicine. But what does this really mean? What are stem cells, how do they work and why have they been generating so much public interest? On this episode, Richie sits down with Dr. Andras Nagy, world-renowned Senior Scientist at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, to discuss his breakthroughs in stem cell research and the ethical challenges facing the field. We also hear from Anton and James, as they break down the history of stem cell research and where we stand today. They also speak on how stem cell hype can be harmful to patients.",
