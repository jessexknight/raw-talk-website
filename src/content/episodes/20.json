  "notes": "Moving forward with this month's theme of Our PIs, we sit down with behavioural pharmacologist and epilepsy research champion, Dr. McIntyre Burnham. Dr. Burnham is a Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto and currently co-directs a province-wide epilepsy research program called EpLink. In this episode, we explore longevity in science, advances in epilepsy care, and training students as thinkers. We also hear from former student Dr. Melanie Jeffrey in \"Patient Perspective\", where she opens up about her experience living with epilepsy and journey becoming a scientist. Please enjoy this special conversation with our oldest and kindest guest to date. Until next time, keep it raw!",
