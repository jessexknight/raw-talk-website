  "notes": "Many of us have experienced depression or have loved ones who have. Reaching out for help is never easy, and when frontline treatments don't work, the effect on quality of life can be devastating. On this week's episode, Kat sits down with MRI-Guided rTMS Clinic Co-Director Dr. Jonathan Downar from the Toronto Western Hospital. Dr. Downar shares his insights on rTMS as an intervention for treatment-resistant depression and other mental illnesses, and discusses recent transformative developments in rTMS procedures that could greatly increase accessibility to those who need it most. Kat and Grace poll the public about their knowledge of alternative treatments for depression and the challenges faced by those who suffer from it. Until next time, keep it raw!",
