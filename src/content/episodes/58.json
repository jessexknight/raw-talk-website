  "notes": "Aging is a biological process that acts on all of us, from the day we're born until the day we die. And for many people, it is a cause for concern. In fact, some scientists believe aging should be classified as a disease. Memory loss, aches and pains, wrinkles, loneliness - there are a lot of reasons for why one might fear getting old. On this episode of Raw Talk, we talk to memory expert Dr. Morris Moscovitch to unpack how and why our memory suffers as we age and discuss the ways in which memory loss can be delayed. Richie explains some of the molecular mechanisms surrounding aging. Finally, we spoke with Dr. Esme Fuller-Thomson, who shares why we may not need to be as worried about our aging population as we thought. She also voices her thoughts on creative considerations to improve healthcare for older adults as well as how to make our cities more age-friendly. Written by: Melissa Galati",
