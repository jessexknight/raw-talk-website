  "notes": "When you're watching a hockey game or even playing sports yourself, do you ever think about concussions? What do athletes or the public think know about concussions? What do our experts at U of T say? In the sixth episode, we continue the theme of \"Neurotrauma\" with a special focus on sport concussions. &nbsp;Tune in as we hear Jabir & Richie interview Dr. Andrew Baker, Hillary ask U of T-ers what they know about concussions, and Dr. Michael Hutchison of U of T's Concussion Program emphasize what we need to be cautious about when dealing with a potential concussion on our new segment, Life Supply. Until next time, keep it raw!",
