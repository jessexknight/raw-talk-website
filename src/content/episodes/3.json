  "notes": "We're excited to introduce October's theme of \"The Physician-Scientist\" with a man whose talents go beyond the bench and bedside: Dr. Norman Rosenblum. In this episode, you'll hear what led Dr. Rosenblum to combine clinical practice with research, his opinion on the physician-scientist being an \"endangered species\", and the emerging technologies that have, and continue to shape the future of pediatric nephrology research - a topic further explored in our very first \"Flashback Friday\" segment. \"Ask a Student\" is back, and this time, MD-PhD candidate Swapna Mylabathula joins us to talk about her motivations and the work she has been involved with so far. Be sure to tune in. Until next time, keep it raw!",
