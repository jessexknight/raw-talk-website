  "notes": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating and misunderstood disease that affects 20 million people globally. Raw Talk had the chance to attend a screening of the award-winning documentary, Unrest. Unrest explores the personal journey of Jennifer Brea from ME/CFS patient to advocate to storyteller. Join Grace and Melissa as they reflect on the compelling documentary and share the unique perspectives of the event moderator, Scott Simpson, co-founder of Millions Missing Canada; as well as panelists Dr. Wilfred de Vega, ME/CFS scientist; Larissa Fan and Kirsten Dahlin Nolan, ME/CFS patients and advocates; and Dr. Sarah Selke, physician specializing in ME/CFS. We explored everything from proposed causes of ME/CFS, to diagnostic criteria, to treatments and coping mechanisms. Press play to learn more about the millions that medicine left behind. A big thank-you to Laura Best and SciComm Toronto for bringing this topic to our attention.",
