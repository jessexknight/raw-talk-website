  "notes": "As a patient, you would want the best care to come to you. You would want to be able to access health services, empathetic staff, and any medications you need. As a citizen, you likely want that for others who are in need of healthcare assistance. So why is this not the case once people are behind bars? \"Imagine yourself in a box trying to reach out for help.\" That is what one of our guests, Lawrence Da Silva, host of Voices Inside and Out, described what it was like to be in need of healthcare services in prison. In this episode, we dive deep into the reality that is healthcare in a prison setting. We are also joined by Catherine Latimer, the executive director of the John Howard Society, and Dr. Kiran Patel, a staff psychiatrist at CAMH's Forensic Division. They touch on topics like the accessibility of care as related to the Canada Health Act, specific challenges like mental health and the effect of prison transfers, and what is being done by organizations like the John Howard Society to help. We hope this episode can highlight some important aspects about the reality of life behind bars.",
