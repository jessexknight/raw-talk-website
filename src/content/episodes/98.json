  "notes": "Have you ever wondered how the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) decides what substances are banned in professional sport? Or what it’s like to get tested for prohibited substances? In this episode of Raw Talk, we interview experts on anti-doping and the use of performance enhancing drugs. James Fitzgerald explains the many tools that WADA uses to combat doping in sport, from dried blood spot analysis to machine learning. We also speak to two Canadian Olympic athletes, Evan Dunfee and Maddy Kelly, about their experiences getting tested, what kinds of pressures they felt to perform, and the tainted beef controversy. Lastly, Dr. Dean St. Mart tells us about the health risks of steroids - in the context of bodybuilding - from androgen receptors to “blasting and cruising”, and explores whether its possible to use such performance enhancing drugs safely. We hope you enjoy the expertise and diverse perspectives our fascinating guests shared with us on this week’s episode.",
