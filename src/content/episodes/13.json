  "notes": "We can't live without air, but we also can't live with air if we can't breathe. Tune into this episode to hear Dr. Shaf Keshavjee (Surgeon-in-Chief at the University Health Network, Officer of Order of Canada, innovator of the ex-vivo lung perfusion system, and co-founder of the Latner Thoracic Surgery Research Laboratories with Dr. Mingyao Liu) talk everything lung transplants, including his insights on the Toronto technique, and the future of patient outcomes. With regeneration and stem-cells being all the talk of the century, it's important to understand what this means for us when it comes to breathing, living better, and beyond. To add onto this theme, Word On The Street gives you coverage on what the public has to say about the idea of super organs as a developing result of regenerative medicine. Until next time, keep it raw!",
