  "notes": "The focus in childhood cancer is often solely on treating the disease, but what about the costs -  both health and financial - that patients and their families must bear? Join Melissa as she sits down with Dr. Sumit Gupta, Paediatric Oncologist in the Division of Haematology/Oncology at SickKids, Chair of the Unit for Policy and Economics Research in Childhood Cancer (PERCC), Associate Chair of the Lancet Oncology Commission on sustainable pediatric cancer care and a member of the Children's Oncology Group acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) committee, to talk about the long-term effects of childhood cancer and its treatment, and his work on building an investment case for childhood cancer treatment in low and middle-income countries. Dr. Vicky Forster, a cancer researcher and survivor of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chats with Kat about her experience as a cancer survivor and the need to involve patients and families in cancer research. Kat also breaks down the cost, and cost effectiveness of running a childhood cancer treatment centre in our Journal Club segment. Until next time, keep it raw!",
