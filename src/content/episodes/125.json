  "notes": "Welcome to the Raw Talk Reunion mini series where we touch base with past team members! In the previous episode (#124), we spoke with our Co-Founders to hear all about how the podcast came about. In this episode (#125), we catch up with more Raw Talk Podcast alum who were integral members of the podcast during past seasons. We explore how their involvement with the podcast influenced their personal and professional lives, where their paths have led since their time with us, and the wisdom they offer to our listeners.",
