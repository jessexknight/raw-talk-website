  "notes": "Hey Raw Talk listeners! The start of October also marks the start of Mental Illness Awareness Week, so we sat down with Dr. Robert Levitan, a clinician-scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. In this episode, Dr. Levitan talks about how his patients inspired him to pursue research on seasonal mood disorders, the role of both genetics and the social environment in causing mood disregulation, and what physicians and researchers can do to battle stigma around mental illness. Tune in to hear from Craig & Kat as they take to the streets of Toronto to find out what people think about the influence of technology on mental health.",
