  "notes": "Pharmaceutical drugs are a pillar of modern healthcare - from preventative medicines to life-saving therapies. We therefore rely on pharmaceutical companies to discover, develop, and deliver new drugs to patients in need. We know that this process is both risky and expensive, but does that justify the drug prices we see in Canada today? Who decides whatâ€™s a fair drug price anyways?  And what is the role of academic science in this whole operation? Join us as we answer these questions and more, with our expert guests: Dr Alison Symington, consultant with Life Sciences Ontario, describes the process of drug discovery and the relationships between academia and industry. Dr. Wong-Rieger, President and CEO of Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders, describes the challenges faced by individuals with rare diseases. Dr. Nigel Rawson, Senior Fellow with the Fraser Institute, introduces us to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board and their upcoming changes. Finally, Dr. Joel Lexchin, Emergency physician at the University Health Network and Canadian drug policy expert, explains some of the challenges to setting fair drug prices in Canada.",
