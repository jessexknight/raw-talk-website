Tune in to this week's episode, featuring Dr. Jodie Jenkinson, a professor in the Biomedical Communications (BMC) program at the Institute of Medical Science. Dr. Jenkinson talks about how she was able to combine her two loves: science and art, the research going on in her lab on visualization strategies to improve life science education, and details the unique aspects of the BMC program. In this episode's #AskAStudent, Matan Berson, a MScBMC candidate and creator of the Raw Talk logo, shares his own experience in the BMC program. Until next time, keep it raw!",
