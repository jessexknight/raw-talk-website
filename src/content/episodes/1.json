  "notes": "On the first episode of the podcast, the Raw Talk team discusses all you need to know about the show, from inspiration to implementation, and everything in between. You'll learn why a podcast and video series make a winning combination, and how we're using themes, to provide more engaging content. We also spend a good portion introducing ourselves - sometimes revealing a little too much - while playing a game of \"Kat Chats.\" We've got big plans for Season 1, and we can't wait for you to hear what's in store. Until next time, keep it raw!",
