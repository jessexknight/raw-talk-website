  "notes": "Although the relief of pain and suffering is inherent in all fields of medicine, there's one specialty in particular where this aspect of care is truly the focus. While you may be unfamiliar with the field of palliative care, which aims to improve quality of life and provide comfort to patients and loved ones, it has made great strides in the last few decades. In this episode, Eryn and Kat sit down with Dr. Camilla Zimmermann, Head of the Division of Palliative Care at the University Health Network. Dr. Zimmermann debunks some of the myths surrounding palliative care and discusses its past and current clinical and research landscape. She also shares her personal training journey and details the recent development of the new Royal College subspecialty training program in palliative medicine. Eryn also met with Dr. Mitali Vatsraj, one of the program's first residents, who shares the story of how she became inspired to work in this field. Until next time, keep it raw!",
