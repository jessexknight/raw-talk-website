  "notes": "In this session of the Raw Talk Podcast, we are happy to welcome the incredibly accomplished Dr. Molly Shoichet to the show! Dr. Shoichet shares her love for collaboration, working at the interface of different fields, and engaging the public in science. You'll also learn how she found her way back to academia after a successful industry career and what she looks for in potential trainees. We're also excited to introduce our very first \"Ask a Student\" segment with PhD Candidate, Nick Mitrousis. Nick provides insight into being a student in the Shoichet lab and what he sees as the future of polymer science and regenerative medicine. This one is not to miss. Until next time, keep it raw!",
