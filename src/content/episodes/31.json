  "notes": "What do sex and gender have to do with neuroscience? Join Jabir as he sits down with Dr. Gillian Einstein, neuroscientist in the Department of Psychology and the Wilfred and Joyce Posluns Chair of Women's Brain Health and Aging, to find out! Hear about her transition from studying art history to systems neuroscience, how the fields of sex/gender research and neuroscience intersect, the importance of a \"situated\" approach to neuroscience, and get a taste of the diverse research going on in Dr. Einstein's lab, from exploring sex differences in dementia to untangling the interactions between estrogen, cognition, and aging in women. Tune in to hear about the groundbreaking study that found the link between hormones, brain development, and behaviour, in our \"Journal Club\" segment. Until next time, keep it raw!",
