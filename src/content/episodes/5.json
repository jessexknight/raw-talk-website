  "notes": "Welcome to the fifth episode of the Raw Talk Podcast! We are excited to reveal this month's theme: \"Neurotrauma\". In our first instalment, surgeon-scientist Dr. Michael Fehlings joins us to speak about his early training, translatable research focus, and his experience as one of the Institute of Medical Sciences' first MSc-to-PhD transfer students. We cover the impact of his thesis work in our very first \"Classics\" segment and in \"Mentor's Corner\", we sit down with Dr. Fehlings' former supervisor and long-standing collaborator, Dr. Charles Tator. Here, Dr. Tator describes his personal and professional relationship with Dr. Fehlings over the years and gives his advice to those interested in pursuing concussion and spinal cord research. Be sure to tune in! Until next time, keep it raw.",
