  "notes": "You've spent your entire life wiring your brain to make you ... you! So, if your brain changes, you change - right? On this episode, Melissa and Swapna chat with Dr. Carmela Tartaglia, a Clinician-Investigator at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre at Toronto Western Hospital, to shed light on a form of early onset dementia - frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Dr. Tartaglia is also the Marion and Gerald Soloway Chair in Brain Injury and Concussion Research and she brings to light some common misconceptions about the diagnosis, prevalence, and treatment of concussion. In hopes of understanding how exercise can benefit those with neurodegenerative disease, James sits down with Dennis Hunkin, and learns how he has taken up boxing to fight back in his battle against Parkinson's. Finally, Anton explores a taboo, yet prevalent societal issue of intimate partner violence induced concussions, with leading expert Dr. Eve Valera from Harvard Medical School. Definitely one you won't want to miss! Until next time, keep it raw!",
