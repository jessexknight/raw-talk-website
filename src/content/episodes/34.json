  "notes": "If there's one aspect of your learning you could simulate, what would that be? In this episode, Jabir sits down with Dr. Ryan Brydges, Director of Research at the Allan Waters Family Simulation Centre, and health professions education scientist at the Wilson Centre, to explore how simulation can impact health policy and patient care. Dr. Brydges also talks about his journey into simulation research, the meaning behind health professions education, and what it takes to build a successful research program. Plus, Eryn meets the simulation team at the Alan Waters Family Simulation Centre to debunk common misconceptions, highlight recent case scenarios, and predict the future state of the field. They also surprise Eryn and Jabir with a simulation experience during their visit. Until next time, keep it raw!",
