  "notes": "While cancer is still a scary word, roughly 75% of people diagnosed with cancer will survive long-term. But how are these patients supported in the long term, as they deal with late side effects from their treatments? Join Kat and Melissa as they sit down with Dr. Jennifer Jones, Director of the Cancer Rehabilitation & Survivorship Program and Senior Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, to discuss the importance of caring for patients throughout the entire disease process, how she developed an integrated clinical and research survivorship program, and the 3 focus areas of her research (i.e., descriptive, intervention development, knowledge translation). Eryn chats with Lloyd Davidson, a Hodgkin's lymphoma survivor, who chronicles his cancer journey and his experience with the survivorship program. Until next time, keep it raw!",
