  "notes": "We couldn't have chosen a better scientist to wrap up this month's theme of \"Foundational Science\" than Dr. Derek van der Kooy, Head of the Neurobiology Research Group at the Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research. His team conducts basic science research in developmental and stem cell biology, as well as in understanding the neurobiology of motivation and uncovering learning and memory genes. We sit down with Dr. van der Kooy to discuss his own graduate school experience, his lab's groundbreaking discovery of the presence of stem cells in the adult mammalian eye, and the perks and challenges of overseeing such a diverse range of research projects. In our popular Ask a Student segment, Kat and Eryn chat with one of Dr. van der Kooy's PhD students, Samantha Yammine, about her research on neural stem cells, why it is vital for basic scientists to make their work accessible to the general public, and her amazing strides in promoting science communication through social media (check her out on Instagram & Facebook: @science.sam). We also travel back in time to meet \"the father of modern neuroscience,\" Santiago Ramon y Cajal, in our Flashback Friday segment. We hope you enjoy this episode as much as we do. Until next time, keep it raw!",
