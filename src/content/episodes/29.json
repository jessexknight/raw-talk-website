  "notes": "Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, but what makes it so difficult to treat? What is tumor hypoxia and how can it influence biology to drive a poor prognosis? In this episode, Richie sits down with Dr. Brad Wouters, the Executive Vice President of Science and Research at UHN to discuss the vast advancement in the field and the need for collaborative integration between basic and clinical research in order to drive treatment and improve outcomes.
