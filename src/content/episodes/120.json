  "notes": "In an era where medications like Ozempic are gaining popularity for their off-label use as weight loss drugs, the dialogue on societal perceptions of weight and health is increasingly relevant. Listen in on our thought-provoking discussions featuring Ali Eberhardt (registered dietician at the Provincial Adult Tertiary Specialized Eating Disorders Program) and Dr. Catherine Sabiston, (Canada Research Chair in Physical Activity and Mental Health) as we explore how societal structures, media, and body ideals intertwine to shape our understanding of weight loss.",
