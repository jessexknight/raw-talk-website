  "notes": "Welcome to episode seven of the Raw Talk podcast! We're excited to introduce this month's theme of \u00ab IMS Professional Programs \u00bb with a special focus on translational research. This week's episode features Mr. Richard Foty, the Network and Community Coordinator of the Translational Research Program (TRP), a new master's degree for health research translators. Rich talks about he got involved in the program, the tools students of the TRP learn to make an impact on the healthcare delivery system, and where he sees himself after the completion of his graduate studies. To top it off, we have some excellent segments in store, including a sit-down with Director Dr. Joseph Ferenbok in &nbsp;\"Mentor's Corner\" and this week's \"Ask A Student\" features members of Timely, a student-led initiative out of the TRP. Until next time, keep it raw!",
