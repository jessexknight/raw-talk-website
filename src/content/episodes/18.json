  "notes": "Even the simplest movements, like picking up your coffee cup, are actually the result of very complex processes and signalling in your nervous system. While we might not put too much thought into the mechanisms that underlie how we move, this week's guest is interested in just that. Dr. Robert Chen, neurologist and scientist, is working to understand how our brain controls our movements, and how this process is impaired in patients with movement disorders, like Parkinson's Disease (PD). Tune in to the second episode under the theme of Neuroimaging to hear all about cutting-edge imaging techniques, learn about the plastic brain, and get a taste of the complexity of movement disorders. In \"Ask a Student\", we also hear from James Saravanamuttu, a student in Dr. Chen's lab, about his work using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to study PD and get his advice on what students should know before applying to grad school. Until next time, keep it raw!",
