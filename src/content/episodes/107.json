  "notes": "In 2021, Dr. David Julius and Dr. Ardem Patapoutian won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for their discoveries related to temperature and touch receptors. In this episode, Dr. Rose Hill and Dr. Robert Bonin introduce us to this topic of  sensory perception, specifically touch and pain. Dr. Bonin describes how we experience pain, delving into acute vs chronic pain, thresholds to pain, and the distinction between nociception and pain. Dr. Hill also shares about her experience being in Dr. Patapoutian's Nobel winning lab, and her work on the perception of itch. Additionally, we get a deeper look into the inner workings of the Nobel Prize, as Dr. Abdel El Manira shares about his time on the Nobel Committee and the inner workings of the Nobel. Join us on this episode, as we unravel touch and the Nobel Prize.",
