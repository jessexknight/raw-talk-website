We'll discuss emerging medical devices, the legalization of marijuana in Canada, indigenous health, and to start us off - graduate student mental health. These topics, plus many more as we dive into sharing the diverse stories and perspectives behind medical science issues and discoveries. See you in a couple of weeks\u2026 and until then, keep it raw!",
