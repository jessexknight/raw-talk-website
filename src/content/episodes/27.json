  "notes": "Throughout their many years of training, medical students will learn everything they need to know to provide adequate medical care. This curriculum includes specialized medical knowledge and skills, but also encompasses all the specific behaviours we consider to be \"professional\". On this episode, you'll hear from Dr. Shiphra Ginsburg, a clinician-educator at the Wilson Centre for Research in Education. Dr. Ginsburg is a staff respirologist at Mount Sinai Hospital, and Director of both the Eliot Phillipson Clinician-Educator Training Program as well as Education Research and Scholarship in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. On this episode we explore what Dr. Ginsburg refers to as a series of \"happy accidents\" that led her to study the understanding and assessment of professionalism in medical learners. She subsequently completed her PhD in medical education and discusses how this process led her to focus on the language used by clinical supervisors to assess medical learners in the workplace. You'll also hear James and Eryn chat with one of Dr. Ginsburg's mentees, Dr. Lindsay Melvin, who discusses her work assessing the efficacy and role of podcasts and other technologies in medical education. Until next time, keep it raw!",
