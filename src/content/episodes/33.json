  "notes": "On this episode of Raw Talk, we focus on a topic that affects us so intimately: sleep. Join Jabir as he sits down with sleep physiologist and author, Dr. Richard Horner, to discuss why we and other living things sleep, how the brain changes during sleep, and what makes sleep different from anesthesia. The two also speak in great detail about Dr. Horner's book, The Universal Pastime: Sleep & Rest Explained, and his thoughts on a second project. Finally, Swapna and Anton draw our attention to the consequences of sleep deprivation and the impact of general anesthesia on patients and medical care, with the help U of T students and faculty. Special thanks to Dr. Beverly Orser, a clinician-scientist and long-time collaborator of Dr. Horner, for her valuable insights. Until next time, keep it raw!",
