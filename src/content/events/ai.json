  "descr": " Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in medicine. This has led to the development of cutting-edge treatments and diagnostic tools. However, a lack of understanding of AI often results in either misplaced distrust in its use, or disregard for potential limitations and ethical consequences. At Medicine Meets Machine, we unpacked this topic with two distinct panels on: 1) Current Applications & Limitations of AI in Medicine and 2) Ethical & Future Considerations of AI in Medicine. Our panelists shared diverse perspectives from healthcare, academia, industry, and policy development.",

      "descr": "There is a lot of information out there about what Artificial Intelligence is and how it's being used in medicine. The focus of this panel was on current applications & limitations of AI in medicine, with the goal of clarifying the realities of where we are with AI development for attendees. Panelists were asked about how their field has changed with the introduction of AI, challenges they face related to using AI, how the role of doctors is affected, why there might be gaps in public knowledge about the realities of AI, and what the most important considerations should be when beginning to work in AI.",
